## First Things First

Here are a few things you can do right now to check how bad (or good) your privacy practices are online:

 1. Access https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to check what data of yours has been leaked in the past
     * *For developers, you can also use their [API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) to check if any of your passwords have been leaked (and cracked). It's a genius system built on a k-anonymity model that preserves your privacy while allowing you to check for password leaks. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUb5iknVJs) and [this repo](https://github.com/mikepound/pwned-search) for more info.*

 2. Sign Up to [Mine](https://saymine.com/) to see who owns your data and request its deletion with one click.
 
## Simple Tips for Enhanced Privacy

  * **Use a privacy-focused browser:** Most browsers these days are feature-rich and provide a good user experience. Why not pick one that values your privacy then?

  * **Use strong passwords:** Really. Use a mix of numbers, upper and lowercase letters, symbols, and make sure your passwords have a good length. This goes a long way. Easy passwords **will** be broken at some point.
  
  * **Do not re-use passwords:** Try as hard as you can not to re-use passwords. This is a bad practice that makes multiple accounts vulnerable if only one password leaks. 

  * **Use a password manager:** A summary of the points above. Keeping track of long, one-use passwords is hard. Get a password manager to do it for you.

  * **Use multi-factor / two-factor authentication:** Using 2FA or multi-factor authentication makes it significantly harder for anyone to break into your accounts.
  
  * **Never ever use websites without HTTPS:** HTTPS, usually represented by a green lock next to the URL on your browser, ensures your connection to websites is securely encrypted. This means you can send data (mostly) without any risk of it ending up in the wrong hands. Websites without HTTPS are dangerous and likely to leak your data.
  
  * **Try out a privacy-focused search engine:** Its results will probably not be as good as Google's, but it will likely get the job done most of the time. You can always go to Google if you can't find a result.

  * **Cover your webcam:** Need to use your webcam for an online meeting? Fine. Otherwise, keep it covered with a sticker or a designated webcam cover thingy.

  * **Do not send private pictures over the internet:** Better if you don't take them at all. But hey, if you gotta take 'em, and you gotta send 'em, at least omit your face.

  * **Stay as far away from Big Tech as possible:** If you truly care about your privacy, you should avoid Google, Facebook, and gang as much as possible. They have horrible track records when it comes to data privacy. This is quite hard, I know. After all, I'm writing this on a Microsoft service. 
  
  * **Prioritize Open Source Software:** Open Source means that the code for the software is open and available for all to see and test. This means it is **more likely** (not certain) to be well-tested for vulnerabilities and privacy issues.
  
  * **Avoid doing anything important on public Wi-Fi networks:** Public networks make you subject to attacks. Avoid accessing your bank account on them, for example.

  * **Enable 'Do Not Track' headers on your browser** Search your browser's settings for 'Do Not Track' or 'DNT' header preferences. Enabling this makes your browser indicate to websites that you do not wish to be tracked. It doesn't ensure you will not be tracked, far from it, but it could help if the website respects the header.
  
  * **Start slow:** Trying to switch your whole lifestyle to enhance privacy doesn't happen overnight. Small steps are the way to go.
